## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for my portfolio website. This document provides an overview of my creative process, the challenges I encountered during the development of this site, and the key lessons I learned along the way. My portfolio showcases my skills in illustration, web design, and photography.

## Process
My process for developing this portfolio began with a clear planning phase, I started by defing my niche, making a sitemap and a user jouney map followed by designing low-res and high-res wireframes in User Experience class, where I defined the structure and content I wanted to include. I opted for a minimalist design of one single page scrolling website that lets my work speak for itself without overwhelming visitors with too much information or design elements.

1. **Planning**: Outlining the website's architecture, including the navigation and key sections (Home, About, Services, Works, Contact).
2. **Design**: Creating wireframes and mockups in Figma, followed by graphic elements in Adobe Illustrator.
3. **Development**: Coding the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I integrated a responsive design to ensure it works well on all devices.
4. **Testing**: Conducting both functional and user interface testing to ensure cross-browser compatibility and a seamless user experience.

## Challenges and Solutions
### Challenge 1: Responsive Design
Ensuring the website looked good and functioned well on all devices was challenging. Initially, some images did not resize properly on mobile devices.

**Solution**: I implemented flexible image grids and used CSS Flexbox and media queries to adjust layouts and image sizes based on the screen dimensions.

### Challenge 2: Portfolio Load Times
High-resolution images in my photography section slowed down page load times, affecting user experience and SEO.

**Solution**: I optimized all images for the web using compression tools, which significantly improved load times without compromising image quality.

### Challenge 3: User Navigation
Feedback from early testers in the UX class indicated that the map displayed in the contact section was unnecessary for the portfolio.

**Solution**: I improved the user experience by removing the map, that made the site more clean and modern feel.

## Lessons Learned
Developing this portfolio taught me several valuable lessons:
- **The importance of pre-planning**: Adequate planning before starting the design and development phase can save a lot of time and resources.
- **Feedback is invaluable**: Regular testing and feedback helped refine the user experience significantly.
- **Continuous learning**: The need to keep up-to-date with new web technologies and design trends is crucial in this fast-evolving field.

## Conclusion
This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of the dynamic nature of web design and user interaction. I look forward to applying these insights to future projects.
